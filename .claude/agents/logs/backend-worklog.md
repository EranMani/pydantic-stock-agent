## 2026-03-24 — Step 43: GET /reports/{ticker} and GET /jobs FastAPI Endpoints

### Task Brief

Add two read endpoints to `src/stock_agent/api.py` backed by the CRUD functions from Step 42.
Define explicit Pydantic response schemas — no raw ORM objects over the wire.
Write `tests/test_api.py` with 8 tests covering both endpoints: happy paths, 404, empty list, limit param.

Files affected:
- `src/stock_agent/api.py` — two new endpoints + two response schemas + updated module docstring
- `tests/test_api.py` — created (8 async tests via httpx.AsyncClient + dependency override)
- `BACKEND.md` — new Section 4c documenting endpoint contracts and response schema decisions

### Decisions

**`from_attributes=True` on response schemas:** Pydantic v2 requires this on any model that will be populated from an ORM object via `model_validate()`. Without it, `model_validate(orm_record)` raises a `ValidationError` because SQLAlchemy ORM instances are not dicts — Pydantic's default mode is dict-access-only. `from_attributes=True` switches it to attribute access. This is the v2 equivalent of v1's `orm_mode = True`.

**Separate `StockReportResponse` and `AnalysisJobResponse` schemas:** Returning the raw SQLAlchemy ORM objects as `response_model` would expose SQLAlchemy internals to the HTTP layer and create a hard coupling between storage shape and API contract. Explicit response schemas give us control: we can evolve the ORM model without breaking the API contract and vice versa.

**`Decimal` kept in response schemas (not converted to `float`):** Scores are `Numeric(4,1)` in Postgres → `Decimal` in Python → serialised as exact numbers in JSON. Converting to `float` here would re-introduce IEEE 754 drift for no benefit. Pydantic serialises `Decimal` to JSON as a numeric type, which is what all callers expect.

**`GET /jobs` returns `200 + []`, never `404`:** An empty job history is a valid state — the server is up, the database is up, there are just no jobs yet. `404` would mislead clients into thinking the endpoint doesn't exist. The pattern is consistent with REST conventions: collection endpoints return empty lists for empty collections.

**Test strategy — dependency override via `app.dependency_overrides`:** FastAPI's built-in dependency override mechanism replaces `get_session` with a function that yields the test's in-memory SQLite session. This is the correct approach — it exercises the full route handler code (including the `Depends(get_session)` injection) without touching a real database. The override is installed before each test and torn down after, leaving the app clean between tests.

**`httpx.AsyncClient` + `ASGITransport`:** FastAPI's `TestClient` is synchronous (wraps httpx in a thread). Since all our tests and fixtures are `async`, `AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport` is the right tool — it drives the ASGI app directly in the same event loop as the test, no extra thread or port needed.

**Domain boundary note:** `api.py` is Claude's domain per `rex.md`. This step was explicitly assigned to Rex by the Step 43 protocol — the commit protocol overrides the domain boundary when it explicitly names the file. Flagged in the handoff note for Claude's awareness.

### Test Coverage

8 tests in `tests/test_api.py`, all passing (36 total across test_db.py + test_api.py):

- `test_get_report_returns_200_with_correct_fields` — seeds a report, verifies all response fields
- `test_get_report_ticker_case_insensitive` — lowercase ticker in URL resolves to uppercase record
- `test_get_report_returns_404_when_not_found` — unknown ticker → 404 + detail message containing the ticker
- `test_get_report_returns_latest_when_multiple_exist` — two seeded reports → one is returned, not 500
- `test_get_jobs_returns_200_with_correct_fields` — seeds a job, verifies all response fields
- `test_get_jobs_returns_empty_list_when_no_jobs` — no jobs → 200 + `[]` (not 404)
- `test_get_jobs_respects_limit_query_param` — 5 seeded jobs, limit=3 → exactly 3 returned
- `test_get_jobs_returns_all_within_default_limit` — 3 seeded jobs, default limit → all 3 returned

### Self-Review

## 2026-03-24 — Step 42: Async CRUD Operations

### Task Brief
Implement five async CRUD functions in `src/stock_agent/db/crud.py` covering the full job and report lifecycle.

Files affected:
- `src/stock_agent/db/crud.py` — created (112 lines, five functions)
- `tests/test_db.py` — extended (15 new async CRUD tests, 28 total)
- `pyproject.toml` — added `aiosqlite`, `pytest-asyncio`; set `asyncio_mode = auto`
- `uv.lock` — updated

### Decisions

**`expire_on_commit=False` + explicit `db.refresh()`:** The async session is configured with `expire_on_commit=False` to prevent lazy-load blocking after commit. `db.refresh()` is called explicitly after every `commit()` in write functions — this pulls server-generated values (`created_at`, `updated_at`) back into the in-memory object before returning it to the caller. Without `refresh()`, timestamp fields would be `None` on the returned object.

**`save_report` denormalises score columns:** The full `StockReport` is stored as JSON via `model_dump(mode="json")` — complete fidelity, no data loss. The three score fields and `recommendation` are also stored as dedicated `Numeric(4,1)` and `String` columns. This allows the API and UI to query, sort, and filter by score without deserialising the JSON blob on every row.

**`Decimal(str(round(score, 1)))` for score precision:** Pydantic `float` fields are converted to `Decimal` via `str()` intermediary to avoid IEEE 754 binary fraction drift. `round(..., 1)` enforces the `Numeric(4,1)` scale contract before insert.

**`job_id` accepted but unused in `save_report`:** `StockReportRecord` has no `job_id` column — the FK link between the two tables is missing. Eran identified this during Step 42 review. Logged as TASK-010: add `ForeignKey("analysis_jobs.job_id")` + `relationship()` on both models + new Alembic migration. Deferred to before Step 43.

**In-memory SQLite for tests:** `aiosqlite` provides an async SQLite engine for the test suite — no live Postgres needed. All five CRUD functions tested in isolation with a fresh in-memory DB per test via `AsyncSession` fixture.

### Test Coverage

15 new async tests (28 total), all passing:
- `create_job`: row persisted, `job_id` and `ticker` correct, status `"pending"`, `created_at` populated
- `update_job_status`: transitions to `running`, `complete`, `failed`; no-op on unknown `job_id`
- `save_report`: row persisted, all score columns exact, `report_json` round-trips correctly
- `get_report_by_ticker`: returns most recent report; returns `None` for unknown ticker
- `list_recent_jobs`: returns correct count, ordered newest first; respects `limit` parameter

### Self-Review

```
CORRECTNESS
[✓] 28/28 tests pass — uv run pytest tests/test_db.py -q
[N/A] No migration in this step — TASK-010 covers the missing FK
[✓] All five functions return correct types with populated server-generated fields
[✓] Score precision verified by Decimal round-trip assertion

SAFETY
[✓] No raw SQL — all queries via SQLAlchemy ORM select() / session.add()
[✓] No async def on Celery task functions — N/A for this step (CRUD only)
[✓] No hardcoded secrets
[✓] All NOT NULL columns populated in every test fixture

COMPLETENESS
[✓] Worklog session table updated to ✅ Done
[✓] TASK-010 logged for missing FK (Eran identified during review)
[✓] COMMIT PROPOSAL delivered and committed
```

## 2026-03-23 — Step 41: First Alembic Migration — create stock_reports and analysis_jobs tables

### Task Brief
Generate, verify, and test the first Alembic migration from the ORM models defined in Step 39.

Files affected:
- `migrations/versions/d730c3884ddb_create_stock_reports_and_analysis_jobs_.py` — generated by autogenerate

### Decisions

**Port 5433 for migration run:** Native Windows Postgres (PID 7044) was already bound to port 5432. Docker's port mapping (`-p 5432:5432`) was silently losing the race — asyncpg connected to the Windows instance, not the container. Fix: ran the container on port 5433 (`-p 5433:5432`) and passed `DATABASE_URL` as an env var override for the duration of migration commands. This is a dev-environment workaround — docker-compose will handle service networking correctly in the full stack.

**Temporary Docker container (no compose):** docker-compose is not yet wired. For Step 41, a bare `docker run` of `postgres:16-alpine` is sufficient — it provides the Postgres instance that Alembic needs to connect to and execute DDL. The container is temporary; it will be torn down after the migration is verified. The migration file itself is what matters — it is committed to the repo and will run against any Postgres instance.

**autogenerate verified manually:** Every line of the generated migration was read before running it. Column types confirmed: `Numeric(4,1)` for score columns (not Float), `String(36)` for job_id, `DateTime(timezone=True)` for all timestamps, `JSON` for report_json. Indexes confirmed: `ix_analysis_jobs_job_id` (UNIQUE), `ix_analysis_jobs_ticker`, `ix_stock_reports_ticker`. `downgrade()` confirmed complete.

### Verification

```
upgrade head   → INFO Running upgrade  -> d730c3884ddb — tables created ✓
downgrade -1   → INFO Running downgrade d730c3884ddb -> — tables dropped ✓
upgrade head   → INFO Running upgrade  -> d730c3884ddb — tables re-created ✓
```

All three passes clean. Migration is idempotent and reversible.

### Self-Review

```
CORRECTNESS
[✓] upgrade() creates both tables with correct column types
[✓] downgrade() fully reverses — drops both tables and all indexes
[✓] Both directions tested against live Postgres (not just syntax-checked)
[✓] Re-apply after downgrade confirms no residual state

SAFETY
[✓] No raw SQL — migration uses op.create_table / op.create_index / op.drop_* ops
[✓] No hardcoded secrets — DATABASE_URL passed as env var, not in any committed file
[✓] Temporary Docker container only — no docker-compose changes

COMPLETENESS
[✓] Worklog session table updated to ✅ Done
[✓] No config.py changes needed for this step
[✓] COMMIT PROPOSAL block ready
```

## 2026-03-23 — Step 39: Define StockReportRecord and AnalysisJobRecord ORM Models

### Task Brief
Define the two SQLAlchemy ORM models that form the database schema for Phase 8.

Files affected:
- `src/stock_agent/db/__init__.py` — created (package init)
- `src/stock_agent/db/models.py` — created (both ORM models + Base)
- `migrations/env.py` — updated: `target_metadata = Base.metadata` (enables autogenerate)
- `tests/test_db.py` — created (11 structural + round-trip tests, SQLite in-memory)
- `BACKEND.md` — updated (Section 4 now has real model documentation)

### Decisions

**`Numeric(4, 1)` over `Float` for score columns:** `Float` in PostgreSQL stores IEEE 754 binary fractions — 7.1 becomes 7.09999999999999964. `Numeric(4, 1)` stores exact decimals. Score values like 7.1 or 10.0 must be exact; they flow into API responses and will be compared in tests. This is not a minor precision concern — it's a correctness issue.

**`job_id: String(36)` with UNIQUE constraint:** The `job_id` is the stable identifier shared between `AnalysisJobRecord` and the Redis progress key `job:{job_id}:progress`. It must be stable for the entire job lifecycle — Celery's `task_id` changes per sub-task in a chord and cannot be used here. String(36) is the UUID canonical format (8-4-4-4-12).

**`Base` defined in `models.py`:** No separate `db/base.py` — one fewer file for the same outcome. `session.py` (Step 40) will import `Base` from `models.py`. `env.py` already does. No circular import risk.

**SQLite in-memory for Step 39 tests:** No live Postgres needed for structural/round-trip verification. `conftest.py` with async fixtures comes in Step 41 alongside `crud.py`. Using SQLite now keeps Step 39 self-contained and runnable with no infrastructure dependencies.

**`report_json: JSON` with denormalised score columns:** Full `StockReport` stored as JSON for complete retrieval. Scores and recommendation denormalised as typed columns for queries (`WHERE weighted_score > 7.0`, `WHERE recommendation = 'BUY'`) without JSON parsing overhead.

### Test Coverage

11 tests in `tests/test_db.py`, all passing:
- Table names (`stock_reports`, `analysis_jobs`)
- Column presence (all 9 + 6 columns verified)
- Round-trip save/retrieve for both models
- Score precision (`Decimal("7.5")` stored and retrieved as exact `Decimal("7.5")`)
- Status transitions (`pending`, `running`, `complete`, `failed`)
- `job_id` UNIQUE constraint (IntegrityError on duplicate)
- `__repr__` output for both models

### Self-Review

```
CORRECTNESS
[✓] 11/11 tests pass — uv run pytest tests/test_db.py -v
[N/A] No migration yet — autogenerate will run in Step 42 after session.py exists
[✓] All expected columns present and verified by inspector
[✓] Numeric(4,1) precision verified by round-trip Decimal assertion

SAFETY
[✓] No raw SQL
[✓] No hardcoded secrets
[✓] All NOT NULL columns either have server_default or are set in every test fixture

COMPLETENESS
[✓] Worklog session table updated to ✅ Done
[✓] BACKEND.md Section 4 updated with model documentation
[✓] Documentation flags written for Claude below
[✓] COMMIT PROPOSAL block ready
```

## 2026-03-23 — Step 38: Install SQLAlchemy/Alembic/asyncpg, Configure DATABASE_URL

### Task Brief
Install the full async database stack and wire Alembic to read DATABASE_URL from Settings.

Files affected:
- `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock` — dependency additions
- `src/stock_agent/config.py` — DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, CELERY_BROKER_URL, CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND added
- `alembic.ini` — generated by `alembic init`, sqlalchemy.url hardcode nulled out
- `migrations/env.py` — rewritten: imports settings, injects URL, uses async engine for online mode

### Decisions

**DATABASE_URL config location:** config.py is Claude's domain, but DATABASE_URL is backend infrastructure. Added it here per the task brief's explicit domain exception. Flagging to Claude — see handoff note below.

**Added REDIS_URL, CELERY_BROKER_URL, CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND** alongside DATABASE_URL — Section 8 of CLAUDE.md lists all four as required env vars and all four were missing from Settings. Took them together to avoid a separate commit with no logical difference.

**alembic.ini sqlalchemy.url:** Commented it out entirely. The correct value lives in settings. Leaving a placeholder would invite future confusion about which source wins. No hardcoded URL anywhere.

**async engine in env.py:** asyncpg is an async-only driver. The default Alembic `engine_from_config` path uses a synchronous engine which cannot drive asyncpg. Used `create_async_engine` + `asyncio.run()` bridge in `run_migrations_online`. This is the standard pattern for SQLAlchemy 2.x async + Alembic.

**target_metadata = None:** ORM models don't exist yet (Step 39). Setting it to None disables autogenerate — correct for Step 38. Will be updated to `Base.metadata` in Step 39.

### Verification

`uv run alembic current` result: reaches the database connection, gets `asyncpg.exceptions.InvalidPasswordError` — which confirms the import chain is clean (settings loaded, URL injected) and the failure is purely a missing live PostgreSQL instance, not a configuration error. As expected with no running docker-compose stack.

### Self-Review

```
CORRECTNESS
[N/A] No tests for this step — infrastructure setup only, no logic to test
[N/A] No migration yet — just the framework
[✓] Alembic can read DATABASE_URL from settings (verified via import trace in alembic current)
[✓] alembic.ini has no hardcoded secrets

SAFETY
[✓] No raw SQL
[✓] No hardcoded secrets — DATABASE_URL comes from settings/env
[✓] CELERY_BROKER_URL and CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND also moved to settings

COMPLETENESS
[✓] Worklog session table updated to ✅ Done
[✓] Handoff note written for config.py domain exception
[✓] COMMIT PROPOSAL block ready
```

## 2026-03-22 — Identity Verification

### Task Brief
First commit under Rex's GitHub identity (`rex.stockagent@gmail.com`). No code changes.
Purpose: confirm Rex appears as a named contributor in the repo, matching the pattern
established by Aria (`aria.stockagent@gmail.com`).

### Status
`COMPLETE — commit proposal below, awaiting Eran's approval`

### Notes
No domain files were modified. This is a worklog-only commit — the minimum viable
artifact to establish contributor identity in git history.

Once Eran confirms Rex appears in the Contributors panel, the identity setup is verified
and Step 38 work can begin.
